# Gapa-Game
This is a Sega Genesis game by youtuber gapa, this project uses the SGDK library, a C library.            
I publish this code so that anyone can modify the game for learning purposes.                                          
recommendation: separate the code and void into headers for more convenience when programming,                         
and I recommend having practice and understanding of the limitations of the Sega Genesis before starting. Good luck :D
